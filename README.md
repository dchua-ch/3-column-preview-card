## My process

### Built with

This project was built using a mobile-first workflow and CSS Flexbox. I completed the CSS styling for the mobile layout first before using a media query to construct the desktop layout.

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me to practice my CSS Flexbox skills. In particular, I had some trouble with positioning the "Learn More" button. I highlight one of the challenges I faced while completing this project below.

#### 1. Button alignment using absolute positioning
 
 I found that, in desktop mode, the buttons may lose their horizontal alignment with each other when the viewport is resized by the user. This is shown in the screenshot below.

 To fix this problem, I set my button elements to position: absolute and the "text-container" class to position: relative. The text-container class is set to the three divs containing the three columns. This would allow me to set the position of the buttons relative to the text-container divs.

 I initially tried the following.

```css
.text-container {
    padding: var(--text-container-padding);
    /* add additional padding to account for button */
    padding-bottom: calc(var(--text-container-padding)*2);
    /* to make button positioning relative to .text-container */
    position: relative;   
}


button {
    background-color: var(--headings-buttons-color); 
    border-radius: 1rem; 
    /* adding border:0; gives buttons a flat look */
    border: 0;
    height: 2rem;
    width : 6rem;

    /* set position absolute and shift button to 1 padding above bottom of 
    .text-container div. This will fix button's position when screen is resized.
    Without this, unequal paragraph heights would affect button position */
    position:absolute;
    bottom: var(--text-container-padding);
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
